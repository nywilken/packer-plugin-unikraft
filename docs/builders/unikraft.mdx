Type: `unikraft`

The Unikraft builder uses kraftkit to create runnable Unikraft unikernel images.
The builder uses packer version 1.7.0 and up to create pipelines.
After running the Unikraft builder the end result is one or multiple Unikraft images.
They are situated in a build directory which is created by the Unikraft build system.

The builder wraps around the `kraftkit` build system which relies on `kraft.yaml` files to define builds.
Moreover, `kraft` itself wraps over the `kconfig` build system of Unikraft.
All three together build the images and offer final binaries.

**Required**

- `architecture` (string) - The architecture to build the image for. Example: `x86_64`, `arm64`, `arm`.
- `platform` (string) - The platform to build the image for. Example: `kvm`, `xen`, `linuxu`.
- `build_path` (string) - The path to the build directory. This is the directory where the `kraft.yaml` file is located.

**Optional**

- `target` (string) - The name of the image to build.
- `pull_source` (string) - The name of the application to pull.
- `workdir` (string) - The path to pull the source to. It's a parent directory of `build_path`.
- `sources_no_default` (boolean) - Do not pull the default manifest sources. Required when working with custom repositories.
- `sources` (string list) - The links of the sources to pull.
- `options` (string) - The options to pass to the build system. Options are separated by spaces and of the format `KEY=value`. Currently disabled.
- `log_level` (string) - The log level to use. Can be `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, `panic`. Default: `info`.

### Example Usage


```hcl
 source "unikraft-builder" "example" {
    architecture = "x86_64"
    platform = "qemu"
    build_path = "/tmp/test/.unikraft/apps/helloworld"
    workdir = "/tmp/test"
    pull_source = "helloworld"
    sources_no_default = false
    sources = [ "https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld" ]
    log_level = "info"
 }

 build {
   sources = ["source.unikraft-builder.example"]
 }
```
