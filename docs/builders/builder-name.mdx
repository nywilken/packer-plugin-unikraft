# Unikraft

Type: `unikraft`

<!--
  Include a short description about the builder. This is a good place
  to call out what the builder does, and any requirements for the given
  builder environment. See https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/null
-->

The Unikraft builder uses kraft to create runnable Unikraft unikernel images.
The builder uses packer version 1.7.0 and up to create pipelines.
After running the Unikraft builder the end result is one or multiple Unikraft images.
They are situated in a build directory which is created by the Unikraft build system.

The builder wraps around the `kraft` build system which relies on `kraft.yaml` files to define builds.
Moreover, `kraft` itself wraps over the `kconfig` build system of Unikraft.
All three together build the images and offer final binaries.

<!-- Builder Configuration Fields -->
### Required

- `architecture` (string) - The architecture to build the image for. Example: `x86_64`, `arm64`, `arm`.
- `platform` (string) - The platform to build the image for. Example: `kvm`, `xen`, `linuxu`.
- `build_path` (string) - The path to the build directory. This is the directory where the `kraft.yaml` file is located.

<!--
  Optional Configuration Fields

  Configuration options that are not required or have reasonable defaults
  should be listed under the optionals section. Defaults values should be
  noted in the description of the field
-->
### Optional

- `force` (boolean) - Force rebuilding an unikernel from scratch.
- `target` (string) - The name of the image to build.
- `jobs` (int) - The number of jobs to run in parallel.
- `fast` (boolean) - Build jobs in parallel. 
- `pull_source` (string) - The name of the application to pull.
- `workdir` (string) - The path to pull the source to. It's a parent directory of `build_path`.
- `sources_no_default` (boolean) - Do not pull the default manifest sources.
- `sources` (string list) - The links of the sources to pull.
- `options` (string) - The options to pass to the build system. Options are separated by spaces and of the format `KEY=value`.

### Example Usage


```hcl
 source "unikraft-builder" "example" {
    architecture = "x86_64"
    platform = "kvm"
    build_path = "/tmp/test/.unikraft/apps/helloworld"
    workdir = "/tmp/test"
    pull_source = "helloworld"
    sources_no_default = false
    sources = [ "https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld" ]
 }

 build {
   sources = ["source.unikraft-builder.example"]
 }
```
