# Unikraft

Type: `unikraft`

<!--
  Include a short description about the provisioner. This is a good place
  to call out what the provisioner does, and any additional text that might
  be helpful to a user. See https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/null
-->

Provisioners can't be used in the context of Unikraft.
Images are built at compile time and usually can't be modified after they are done.
Also, there is no standardised shell yet to connect and run commands inside Unikraft.
Thus, the provisioner module is disabled.
